# python-test-driven-development-practice-leap-year-coding-exercise
I am utilizing the Hands-On test Driven Development with Python course in Udemy. It consists of six sections. The third section is a coding exercise using TDD in Python. The coding exercise entails implementing a function in Python that takes in a year and returns true if the year is a leap year and false if it is not.

The algorithm for determining if a year is a leap year is:

 * The year is not divisible by 100
    * But, the year is divisible by 4
* The year is divisible by 100
    * And. the year is divisible by 400
